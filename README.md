Trying to create a ecosystem on the optimism stack













Iâ€™m making an idea for making a launchpad with 0 fees not like the ones which charge you 30% of your allocation and also you need to stake their tokens to get allocation , the ones which dont have 30% fees dont have good projects in their ecosystem . I am also trying to make a swap feature where you get one of the best ui/ux while using it especially on mobile phone.
  -launchpad
  -swap
  -otc market for vested tokens ( game plan )
  -maybe a plugins for website to get payment from web3 people => web2 companies using it to get payment at a cheaper and more efficient way .
